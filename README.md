# The React flavour of Chet's CV


There's not much more to it really. This project is for a website that outlines my Skills, Experience, Projects and other details to act as an online version of my cv.

It's made with React (as the name might hint towards) as a way to both grow my understanding of it and show how I currently use it to create a modern and dynamic user interface.
